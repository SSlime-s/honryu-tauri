   - Create a `config` file in the same directory as the executable
   - Add your API key to the file:

## ‚ÜîÔ∏è Compatibility

Windows 11, macOS, Linux (not wayland)

but I only tested on Windows 11 and **recommend** using it on Windows 11.

Notice: On macOS, application windows cannot span across multiple screens by default, so they can only be displayed on a specific display.
